## About Scrapbook

During the COVID-19 pandemic, I wanted to celebrate **Rakshabandhan** with my loved ones, but since I couldn’t meet them in person, I created an **online scrapbook** in **Angular**.

This project is a **UI experiment**, where different elements **react dynamically** as you flip through the book. It provides an interactive and engaging experience, making digital celebrations feel more personal.

## Features 🎨
- 📖 **Interactive Page Flipping**: Elements react in different ways as you turn the pages.
- 🎭 **Dynamic UI Elements**: Unique animations and styles bring a fresh experience.
- 🎉 **Digital Rakshabandhan Celebration**: A creative way to share memories when meeting in person isn’t possible.
